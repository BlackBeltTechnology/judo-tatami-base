== Introduction

This project contains the transformation steps which are used to make the full transformation pipeline
to create application models from source models for the JUDO platform. This project contains pipeline
steps only which can be utilized in workflows defined in other projects (for example https://github.com/BlackBeltTechnology/judo-tatami-jsl[judo-tatami-jsl])

The orders of steps show the relation between transformation steps source / destination model and how the steps
can be chained.
